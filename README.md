| 19        | Movement      | movement        | text      | Movement of the vehicle. 1 - through (TH), 2 - left-turn (LT), 3 - right-turn (RT).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 20        | Preceding     | preceding       | number    | Vehicle ID of the lead vehicle in the same lane. A value of '0' represents no preceding vehicle - occurs at the end of the study section and off-ramp due to the fact that only complete trajectories were recorded by this data collection effort (vehicles already in the section at the start of the study period were not recorded).                                                                                                                                |
| 21        | Following     | following       | number    | Vehicle ID of the vehicle following the subject vehicle in the same lane. A value of '0' represents no following vehicle - occurs at the beginning of the study section and onramp due to the fact that only complete trajectories were recorded by this data collection effort (vehicle that did not traverse the downstream boundaries of the section by the end of the study period were not recorded).                                                              |
| 22        | Space_Headway | space_headway   | number    | Space Headway in feet. Spacing provides the distance between the frontcenter of a vehicle to the front-center of the preceding vehicle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 23        | Time_Headway  | time_headway    | number    | Time Headway in seconds. Time Headway provides the time to travel from the front-center of a vehicle (at the speed of the vehicle) to the front-center of the preceding vehicle. A headway value of 99                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
